# go-skiplist
Skip List implementation in Golang. I came across the idea and wanted to try out and implementatin for same. It's work in progress the operations 
per second needs work

## API

In case you plan on using the API. ðŸ˜µ

- Insert

```go
   node := list.Insert(int64(num), []byte(fmt.Sprintf("value - %d", num)))
```

- Delete
```go
    deleted := list.Delete(int64(num))
```

- Search
```go
    found , value := list.Search(42)
```

- Iterate
```go
    for pair := range list.Iterate() {
		pair.key 
        pair.value
	}
```
- IsEmpty

```golang
    isEmpty := list.IsEmpty()
```


## Test

It's slow. Painfully slow. But it's ordered ðŸ¤£. Benchmarks based on logarithmic height
of total entries

```
