# go-skiplist
Skip List implementation in Golang. 


## API

In case you plan on using the API. ðŸ˜µ

### Highlights
- Completely for in memory use case.
- Generic supported implementation

- Insert

```go
   node := list.Insert(int64(num), []byte(fmt.Sprintf("value - %d", num)))
```

- Delete
```go
    deleted := list.Delete(int64(num))
```

- Search
```go
    found , value := list.Search(42)
```

- Iterate
```go
    for pair := range list.Iterate() {
	pair.key 
        pair.value
    }
```
- IsEmpty

```go
    isEmpty := list.IsEmpty()
```

- BatchOrderedInsert

```go
// experimental
// requirs an ordered slice of pairs
// imporeves insert performance on avg by 33%
// 
    var pairs []skiplist.Pair
    list.BatchOrderedInsert(pairs)

```

## Test

It's slow. Painfully slow. But it's ordered ðŸ¤£. Benchmarks based on logarithmic height
of total entries. posted results are consistently reproducible on a Ryzen 5600x machine with virtualized 2 Core + 4Gb in WSL

## TODO
- Add Batched Search and Delete also
- Add Range Scan operation 
- Add Batched Multi Operation support
- Add Doubly Linked List supports and Lookup from Tail to optimize for Long Range Scans
- Look into Compare and Swap implementation for SkipList , incorporate the same for thread safe version
